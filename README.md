# Prompt Engineering Training

A self-contained learning environment for mastering prompt engineering across AI models.

## Quick Start

1. Open this repository in Claude Code or your preferred AI assistant
2. The assistant will read `CLAUDE.md` for session protocols
3. Start a learning session - the assistant will guide you through the curriculum

## Curriculum Overview

The training covers 8 sections with 54 trackable sub-skills:

| Section | Focus | Skills |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 1. Foundation Building | Core principles, mental models | 6 |
| 2. Prompt Architecture | Structure, components, formats | 8 |
| 3. Applied Practice | Hands-on task optimization | 7 |
| 4. Debugging & Optimization | Failure analysis, improvement | 7 |
| 5. System Design Thinking | Workflows, multi-agent, scaling | 8 |
| 6. Documentation & Mastery | Library building, meta-learning | 5 |
| 7. Cross-Model Expertise | Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. | 7 |
| 8. Advanced Techniques | Meta-prompting, chaining, etc. | 6 |

## Session Protocol

**Start of Session:**
- AI reads curriculum and all progress files
- Reviews current skill levels
- Suggests next logical focus or asks for preference

**During Session:**
- Structured lessons with examples
- Hands-on practice and iteration
- Real-time feedback and debugging

**End of Session:**
- Append entry to `session_log.md`
- Update skill statuses in `skills_tracker.md`
- Add successful prompts to `prompt_library.md`

## Skill Progression Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⬜ Not Started | Haven't covered this topic |
| 🟡 In Progress | Currently learning |
| 🟠 Practiced | Understand basics |
| 🟢 Competent | Can apply independently |
| ⭐ Mastered | Can teach others |

## Getting Started

Begin your first session by asking:
> "Let's start my prompt engineering training. What should we focus on first?"

The AI will assess your current state and recommend starting with Foundation Building.

## Philosophy

- **Always explain the why** - Understanding beats copying
- **Encourage experimentation** - No single right answer
- **Build incrementally** - Foundations before advanced
- **Document everything** - Your prompt library is an asset
